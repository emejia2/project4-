     <hl>Thomas Jefferson's Rough Draft For The Declaration of Independence  </hl>
 
    <p> We therefore the representatives of the united States of America in General Congress assebled do in the name & by authority of the good people of these states reject and renounce all allegiance & subjections to the kings of Great Britain & all others who may hereafter claim by, through or under them: we utterly disolve all political connection which may heretofore have subsisted between us & the people or parliment of Great Britain: and finally we do assert and declare these colonies to be free and independent states, and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract allies, establish commerce, & do all other acts & things which independent states may of right do.

And for the support of this declaration, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, & our sacred honor. </p>
